This is an event calculator.  
For the bot to work, create a unique token in @BotFather. And write it down instead of the lines "YOUR_TOKEN". 
Write the event and date according to the specified form in the bot. And the bot will tell you how many days are left before this event or how many days ago this event took place. 
Using the blanks of this code, you can refine it so that the bot sends you every day how many days are left before the long-awaited event!
Good luck and see you soon!
